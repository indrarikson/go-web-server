## Overview

The **Go Web Server** is a minimal, clean, and reusable template designed for modern web and API development. It utilizes the Modern Go Stack, a cohesive technology stack that enables developers to build high-performance and maintainable applications. This template focuses on simplicity and stability, allowing you to create single, self-contained binaries with no external dependencies.

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/indrarikson/go-web-server/releases). 

## Features

- **Minimal Design**: The template is lightweight and straightforward, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **Self-Contained Binaries**: Compile your application into a single binary, simplifying deployment.
- **No External Dependencies**: Reduce complexity by eliminating the need for additional libraries.
- **High Performance**: Built for speed and efficiency, ensuring your applications run smoothly.
- **Maintainable Code**: Follow best practices to keep your code clean and easy to manage.

## Technologies Used

The Go Web Server template incorporates the following technologies:

- **Echo**: A high-performance, extensible web framework for Go.
- **Goose**: A database migration tool for Go.
- **HTMX**: A library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML.
- **Koanf**: A lightweight configuration library for Go.
- **Mage**: A make-like build tool for Go.
- **Picocss**: A minimal CSS framework for styling.
- **Slog**: A structured logger for Go.
- **SQLC**: A tool to generate type-safe Go code from SQL queries.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database engine.
- **Templ**: A templating engine for rendering HTML.

## Installation

To get started with the Go Web Server template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/indrarikson/go-web-server.git
   cd go-web-server
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Go modules to manage dependencies. Run:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Build the Application**:
   Compile the application into a binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o myapp .
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start your web server:
   ```bash
   ./myapp
   ```

## Usage

The Go Web Server template is designed to be flexible. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to define routes and handle requests:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
)

func main() {
    e := echo.New()

    e.GET("/", func(c echo.Context) error {
        return c.String(200, "Hello, World!")
    })

    e.Start(":8080")
}
```

This example creates a simple web server that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed at the root URL.

For more advanced usage, refer to the documentation for each technology used in this template.

## Directory Structure

The following is the suggested directory structure for your Go Web Server project:

```
go-web-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ myapp/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.go
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migration.sql
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ handler.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ model.go
â”œâ”€â”€ web/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ templates/
â””â”€â”€ go.mod
```

### Explanation of Directories

- **cmd/**: Contains the entry point for your application.
- **config/**: Holds configuration files and settings.
- **migrations/**: Contains SQL migration files.
- **internal/**: Houses application logic, including handlers and models.
- **web/**: Contains static files and templates.
